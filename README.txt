On Gradescope, we submitted 4 things:

1. Our presentation slides

2. The zipped GitHub Repository (also available here: https://github.com/cindylay/181yfinal-cinashfred)

3. A PDF of our Final Reflection

4. A copy of Ashkon's CS5 Course Materials, that we used as training data (not on GitHub, for Honor-Code reasons....)
